# LaserCore

An [Ion](https://github.com/r2ion/Ion) installer, ~~updater~~ (soon i think), and mod-manager

![Ion screenshot](please add a screenshot)

## Install

Downloads are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/r2ion/LaserCore/releases/latest).

**Windows:** Download `LaserCore_X.Y.Z_x64_en-US.msi` and then run the installer by double-clicking the file.

**Linux:** Download `laser-core_X.Y.Z_amd64.AppImage`, put it in a preferred location and make it executable. Can anyone tell me whatever the fuck a flatpak is

All versions of LaserCore do not currently feature an auto-updater that will ask to self-update on new releases. this is because pepto kinda enjoys eating rocks
